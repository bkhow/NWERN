# NWERN
Work flow for NWERN meteorological and flux data
-------------
-------------
These files include examples of importing aeolian sediment flux weights into DIMA, exporting a report from DIMA, then taking the DIMA format into an R function that will build site specific line graphs of sediment flux at four heights over time. 

I will work on a similar workflow for metorlogical summaries and graphs collected from NWERN met towers. 

Next, I will include Brandon Edwards Python flux integration program, following by graphs.
